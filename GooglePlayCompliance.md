# Google Play Store Compliance Documentation

Last Updated: February 21, 2026

## Overview

This document outlines the compliance measures implemented to address the Google Play Store rejection related to Child Safety Standards for the PorosenoCheck Employee App.

## Issues Addressed

The app was rejected for violating the Child Safety Standards policy. Specifically, the app was missing:

1. Published standards that explicitly prohibit child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE)
2. Contact information of a child safety-specific point of contact
3. Proper declaration of in-app mechanisms for user feedback
4. Compliance with all applicable child safety laws and regulations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Child Safety Policy

Created a comprehensive Child Safety Policy (`ChildSafetyPolicy.md`) that:

- Explicitly prohibits child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE)
- Establishes clear standards for preventing CSAE
- Provides contact information for a child safety-specific point of contact
- Complies with applicable child safety laws and regulations

**Child Safety Point of Contact:**
- Name: Sorokin Dmitry Olegovich
- Email: child.safety@rechain.email
- Phone: +79939038965
- Address: REChain, Inc., Bösch 119, Cournillens 1784, Switzerland

### 2. Policy Integration

Updated existing documentation to reference child safety compliance:

- **Google Play Privacy Policy**: Added a dedicated "Child Safety" section referencing the Child Safety Policy
- **README**: Added "Child Safety" and "User Feedback" sections
- **Account Deletion Rules**: Added child safety compliance references
- **Data Deletion Rules**: Added child safety compliance references

### 3. In-App Feedback Mechanism

Documented the in-app feedback mechanism in the README:

- Users can access feedback options through the app's settings menu
- Feedback mechanism includes options for reporting child safety concerns

### 4. Policy Accessibility

All policies are publicly accessible via GitHub:

- Child Safety Policy: https://github.com/Katya-Solutions-LLC/porosenocheck_for_employee/blob/main/ChildSafetyPolicy.md
